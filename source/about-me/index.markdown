I'm a DevOps Engineer at PayPal in Boston, MA. focused on Ruby, Automation and the future. I spend most of my time in the land of Ruby and [Chef](http://getchef.com).

Here I'll post thoughts, some fact, some not, that drive my work. In my spare time, I do concert photography, bike and drink beers.
